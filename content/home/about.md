Hi! I am Abdallah. Welcome to my homepage. I am an Applied Scientist Intern at Goldman Sachs R&D AI labs. I have obtained my MSc degree in Computer Science from Saarland University. My thesis focuses on leveraging self-supervised learning in domain specific languge models. My research interests include solving real world NLP problems. I can be classified with high confidence as a coffeeholic Ambievert who loves to talk about comedy, travel (below images are my own), politics, and philosophy.
